            <div className="flex text-white mt-5 flex-col gap-5">
                <p>I just want you to know na I won't give up jud lol, I want to fix everything saatoa and I want to make things clear. It's not my intention to make you feel na wakay Karapatan, and need nimog assurance. It is a mental lapse on my end cause wa nako siya na huna huna na informal kaayo akong pag ask. But I promise you, genuine jud akong intentions saimoha, I want you to be my girlfriend, That's why wa nagud kaayo nako naisip tong from last year na nag ask ko, cause sobra na ka nag grow ang bond nato, and I thought na clear na between us akong intention saimoha. </p>
                <p>Love, I don't know ngano nakaingon ka na di ko eager, I am eager gud kaayo sa tanan about you, not just for the 'YES' but also for you love, care, and attention. Want nako na tanan from you, di lang kay para sa 'YES'. That's why I am going beyond my I thought na pinaka effort nako, willing kaayo ko I risk tanan for us to work, so don't tell me na I am not eager saimo, cause that's not true jud. I love you kaayo, angelica. </p>
                <p>So please, unta ma understand nimo akong side gud, it's not something na intentional and aware gud ko, I assumed naman gud na kabalo naka sakong intentions since I told you informally, and I am showing it mansad sakong actions, and I am sorry sad if wa jud kaayo nako na take ug tarong imong padungog, lahi jud akong nasaisip ato. Please anj, I want you so bad, Kung want nimog label, mas want nakog label, ga overthink sad ko that time unsa pay need nako I prove or buhaton, and it turns out we're not on the same page. </p>
                <p>So please, Angelica Mae Liloc, Don't lagot na saakoa lovey, I love you so much jud, I don't want to lose you, I want to fix this! </p>
